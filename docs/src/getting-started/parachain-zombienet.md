# Parachain zombienet

This guide will help you to setup a local parachain network using zombienet. At the end we will have three nodes: Alice, Bob and Charlie. Alice and Bob will be running Polkadot relay chain nodes as validators, and Charlie will be running a relay chain and parachain node. Charlie will be our contact point to the parachain network.

## Pulling the image from registry

```bash
docker pull polkadotstorage.azurecr.io/parachain-node:0.1.0
```
