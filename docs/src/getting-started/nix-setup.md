# Nix Setup

This guide will outline how to setup your environment using Nix to get started with the polka-storage project.

## Pre-requisites

> Installing direnv on your system is not required but recommended.

Install direnv by following the [install instructions](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) on their website for your system.

Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) on your system.

Shell command to install Nix:

`sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)`

Some users experience issue with the shell command. If you experience any issue installing Nix try to install Nix with the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

## Building

Clone the repository and go into the directory:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:eigerco/polka-storage.git
cd polka-storage
```

When going into the cloned directory for the first time the required packages will be installed in the Nix environment, this make take some time.
This Nix setup only needs to be done once.

Once the Nix setup has completed we're ready to start building the binaries.

> If you didn't install `direnv` you won't automatically enter the Nix environment.
> To do so, you'll need to run the following command:
> ```
> nix develop
> ```
> For more information, refer to the official Nix guide â€” https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.17/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-develop

To make building simple there are [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) commands setup to get you started.
