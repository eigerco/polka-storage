# Introduction

Welcome to the Polka Storage project!

This project's goal is to deliver a Polkadot-native system parachain for data storage.

Since the Referendum approval we've been busy developing the parachain,
this is our deliverable for Phase 1, composed of:

- Filecoin actor ports:
  - [Storage Provider](./pallets/storage-provider.md) — not including proving mechanisms
  - [Market](./pallets/market.md)
- [CAR file conversion server](./storage-provider-cli/storage.md)
- [Dedicated CLI](./storage-provider-cli/index.md) to take the parachain for a spin, as shown below!
