# mdBook of Polka Storage

## Development

```bash
mdbook serve
```

Symlinks binding doesn't work with hot-reload, so you need to restart the server on your own to pick-up changes from:
- pallet-market.md
- pallet-storage-provider.md
- storage-provider-node.md
- storagext-cli.md

## Build

```bash
mdbook build
```
